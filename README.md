# tictac-toe
 
 A simple console game that prints a number of symbols, players get to place an x(basically playing with number inputs i.e input number 2 will be x then the program automatically picks o and place it in one of the empty spaces ) in the postion they want.
 
 Also the players have a limit of three play and will keep playing until someone losses (either the program or player)
